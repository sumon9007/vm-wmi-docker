# Docker Setup Script Walkthrough

I have created a shell script to automate the installation of Docker on your Ubuntu system.

## Changes Created
- [docker-setup.sh](file:///home/wmiadmin/docker-setup.sh): A bash script that handles:
  - Repository configuration (Official Docker Repo)
  - Keyring management (GPG keys)
  - Package installation (Docker CE, CLI, plugins)
  - User permissions (Adding current user to `docker` group)

## Verification
I have verified the script syntax and permissions:
- Script is executable (`chmod +x` applied).
- Script follows official Docker documentation for Ubuntu.

## Next Steps for You
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./docker-setup.sh
   ```
2. Log out and log back in to apply group changes.
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

# Docker Setup Script Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create a shell script `docker-setup.sh` that automates the installation of Docker Engine on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

## User Review Required
- **Sudo Privileges**: The script requires `sudo` privileges to run.
- **User Group**: The script will attempt to add the current user to the `docker` group to allow running docker commands without `sudo`. This requires a re-login to take effect.

## Proposed Changes
### Root Directory
#### [NEW] [docker-setup.sh](file:///home/wmiadmin/docker-setup.sh)
- Update `apt` package index.
- Install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS.
- Add Docker's official GPG key.
- Set up the stable repository.
- Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.
- Add user to `docker` group.
- Verify installation with `hello-world`.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- User runs `chmod +x docker-setup.sh`.
- User runs `./docker-setup.sh` (script should prompt for sudo or handle it).
- Verify successful execution and output of `hello-world` image.
